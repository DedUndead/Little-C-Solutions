In this exercise the function interfaces aren't fully specified so you need to design the interface
yourself. Note that all the information that the functions need must be passed as parameters.

Define a structure to store car information. The structure must contain the following information:
Make of the car (string), model of the car(string), price(int), co2 emissions g/km (float).

Write a program that stores the structures in a file in binary mode. You can use a fixed file name.
The program allows user to do the following:
5. print all cars in the file
6. add new car to the end of the file (ask user to enter information)
7. quit the program.
