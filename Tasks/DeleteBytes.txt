Write a program that allows user to remove bytes from a binary file.

Program asks user to enter file name and then displays the file size and asks user what to remove.
User enters offset from the beginning of the file and number of bytes to remove. Program then
overwrites the original file with the data where the user specified bytes are removed. Program must
display error message if user tries to remove data past the end of the file or if the offset is invalid.
